description: Map paper claims to code, config, tests, and artifacts for end-to-end traceability. Use when users ask for claim audit trails, evidence mapping, implementation to paper alignment, or submission traceability checks.

# paper-claim-traceability-auditor

Build claim-to-evidence trace maps suitable for audits and submission reviews.

## Execute

1. Extract explicit claims from user text or paper draft sections.
2. Map each claim to code anchors, config anchors, test anchors, and output anchors.
3. Mark missing anchors or weak links as traceability gaps.
4. Distinguish static-confirmable claims from runtime-required claims.
5. Produce a structured traceability matrix with risk levels.

## Repository Anchors

- `doc/`
- `configs/`
- `main/`
- `tests/`
- `scripts/run_onefile_workflow.py`
- `notebook/Colab_Workflow.ipynb`

## Output Contract

- `claim`
- `code_anchor`
- `config_anchor`
- `test_anchor`
- `artifact_anchor`
- `gap_or_status`
